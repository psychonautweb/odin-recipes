        <h3>Sarma is a traditional food in many countries from Balkan</h3>
        <p>In Balkan region it usually consists of minced pork, rice, onion, eggs, thyme and dill rolled in a leaf, usually a cabbage leaf. The baking dish is lined with chopped cabbage and sauerkraut layered with bacon or pork belly and the cabbage rolls, then topped with more sauerkraut and dill sprigs. The cooking water is poured over the assembled tray, a mixture of sauerkraut juice and seasonings. It's a traditional dish to be served for Easter and Christmas meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients, to make it</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cabbage</li>
        <li>450g ground chuck</li>
        <li>220g pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup raw rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (30g) package dehydrated onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 (900g) jar sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>6 medium smoked ribs, ham hocks, or other smoked meat</li>
        <li>1 (220g) can paprika or tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (300g) can tomato soup*</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps, to take it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Cabbage</li>
            <p>Gather the ingredients. Steam the head of cabbage until the outer leaves are limp, then cool slightly and separate the leaves. With a paring knife, remove the tough ribs from the leaves without damaging them. Reserve the tougher outer leaves, but don't use for rolling.</p>
        <li>Make the Filling</li>
            <p>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground chuck, ground pork, rice, and onion soup mix. Adding a small amount of water will make the mixture easier to handle.</p>
        <li>Assemble the Rolls</li>
            <p>Heap 2 tablespoons of filling onto each steamed, prepared cabbage leaf. Fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over the meat. Fold sides to the center and roll away from yourself to encase completely. Repeat until the meat filling is gone.</p>
        <li>Bake the Sarma</li>
            <p>Heat oven to 180 C. Discard the cabbage core and coarsely chop any remaining cabbage except the tough outer leaves you have reserved. Spread the chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch oven. Add the drained sauerkraut. Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam-side down. Cut the smoked ribs into pieces. Space the ribs or other smoked meat of choice between the cabbage rolls. Cover rolls with reserved tough outer leaves. Mix paprika sauce and soup with enough water to make a liquidy consistency. <strong>If you add tomato sauce you will provoke a wrath from Slavic cuisine gods.</strong>  I've warned you. Pour over rolls until mixture is level with rolls, but not over the top. Cover the casserole dish and bake 1 hour. Then reduce temperature to 160 C and bake for 2 more hours. Let sit 20 to 30 minutes before serving. This dish freezes well.
