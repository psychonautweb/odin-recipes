    <h2>Ingredients, to make it</h2>      <h5>10 servings</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1400g baby beef shoulder</li>
        <li>600g veal</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>3 pinches of pepper</li>
        <li>40g salt</li>
        <li>10 lepinja flatbreads</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps, to take it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation, you dummy</li>
            <p>Grind the baby beef and veal, then mix them together, add the salt, and knead the meat by hand for five minutes.</p>
        <li>Refrigeratation, what else</li>
            <p>Refrigerate the meat mixture at 3°C for 12 hours, but it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.</p>
        <li>Crush it, add it, knead it</li>
            <p>Crush the garlic with a garlic press, add it to the meat mixture together with pepper, and knead the meat by hand for 10 minutes.</p>
        <li>Appetitte for destruction</li>
            <p>Two kilos of meat should amount to about 40 tiles of ćevapi sausage - each tile being 5cm long and with a 2cm diameter.
            </p>
        <li>Shape it, the cevapi Shape</li>
            <p>Once you've shaped the tiles, refrigerate them for at least two hours.</p>
        <li>Grill them now. What are you waiting?</li>
            <p>When ready to grill ćevapi, preheat the grill and brush the grid with oil, then place the tiles on the grill and grill them for a few minutes on each side — alternatively, you can pan-grill them, as well.</p>
        <li>Lepinja, secret touch</li>
            <p>As tiles of ćevapi are grilling, split open the lepinja flatbreads, dip them in the fat that has rendered from the ćevapi, then place them on ćevapi to steam as they grill.</p>
        <li>You like them hot</li>
            <p>Serve four tiles inside a single lepinja flatbread, with a side of slices of white onion and a pickled pepper.</p>
